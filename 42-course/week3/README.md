# Week 3

Time: 9-11h

Goals:
- Understand arrays, strings, and pointer basics.
- Implement stable text counting logic.

Tasks:
- Practice char arrays and string traversal.
- Build simplified `wc` for lines/words/chars.
- Validate behavior on empty and one-line files.

Acceptance:
- No out-of-bounds access.
- Word-count logic handles multiple spaces correctly.
- Test notes include edge inputs and observed outputs.

# 42 Paris Style Long-Run Syllabus (36 Weeks)

Base schedule: weekday 1h + weekend 2-3h/day (9-11h/week).
Target: learn both books with enough repetition, projects, and review cycles.

## Stage A (Week 1-6): C Core Foundation
- Focus: syntax, pointers, arrays, files, structs, dynamic memory.
- Book: C Primer Plus core chapters.
- Output: stable C utilities with make/debug discipline.

## Stage B (Week 7-12): ML Foundation
- Focus: end-to-end ML workflow, supervised learning, metrics, first NN.
- Book: Hands-On ML Part I + intro of Part II.
- Output: reproducible notebooks/scripts for baseline models.

## Stage C (Week 13-20): C Deepening (42-style rigor)
- Focus: parser, custom library, data structures, algorithms, mini-shell.
- Output: stronger systems thinking and robust memory management.

## Stage D (Week 21-27): ML Mid-Level Depth
- Focus: feature engineering, CV tuning, ensembles, unsupervised, PCA.
- Output: model-comparison reports and diagnostics.

## Stage E (Week 28-34): Applied Deep Learning + MLOps basics
- Focus: project pipeline, dense/CNN/sequence/attention concepts, inference packaging.
- Output: runnable project entrypoint and deployable inference stub.

## Stage F (Week 35-36): Capstone + Retrospective
- Focus: integration, hardening, profiling, final report.
- Output: capstone demo + next 3-month roadmap.

## Weekly Rule
- Day1: read and summarize only what supports this week's build.
- Day2-Day4: coding iterations.
- Day5: debug, tests, cleanup.
- Weekend: finish project and write retrospective.

## Progress Rule
- Every week must include:
  - at least one runnable program/script
  - at least five tests/manual checks
  - one retrospective note in notes/

# Week 10

Time: 9-11h

Goals:
- Compare linear models and SVM.
- Understand underfitting vs overfitting.

Tasks:
- Train ridge/lasso baseline models.
- Train SVM and tune core hyperparameters.
- Compare performance and complexity.

Acceptance:
- Same split used for fair comparison.
- Hyperparameters and rationale are logged.
- Overfit/underfit diagnosis is documented.

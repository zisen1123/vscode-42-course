# Week 2

Time: 9-11h

Goals:
- Strengthen control flow and function decomposition.
- Write input-safe console tools.

Tasks:
- Review loops, branch combinations, and function signatures.
- Implement `prime_check`, `simple_calc`, `sum_avg`.
- Add invalid-input checks (`scanf` return value).

Acceptance:
- Each program has at least one helper function.
- Build passes with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
- At least 6 manual test cases per program are recorded in `notes/`.

# Week 22

Time: 9-11h

Goals:
- Feature engineering deep dive

Tasks:
- imputation, scaling, encoding, leakage checks
- Keep daily notes in notes/progress.md.
- Add at least 5 test cases in tests/.

Acceptance:
- pipeline avoids leakage and is reproducible
- Weekly retrospective includes mistakes and fixes.

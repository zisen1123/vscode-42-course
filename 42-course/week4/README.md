# Week 4

Time: 9-11h

Goals:
- Use file I/O and string utilities reliably.
- Build grep-like substring matching.

Tasks:
- Practice `fopen`, `fgets`, `fclose`, error paths.
- Implement simplified `grep` for one or more files.
- Print clear errors for unreadable files.

Acceptance:
- Matching lines are printed exactly once.
- Program exits cleanly when one file fails.
- Test cases cover missing file and long-line input.
